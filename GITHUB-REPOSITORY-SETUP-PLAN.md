# GitHub Repository Setup Plan

This document provides a detailed plan for setting up your GitHub repository for the Video Training Funnel project and making your first commit.

## 1. Overview

We'll set up a GitHub repository for your Video Training Funnel project using your GitHub account (username: Drakeyvespropulsion). This plan includes:

- Creating the GitHub repository
- Initializing Git in your local project
- Making your first commit
- Updating necessary files to reflect your repository information

## 2. Repository Creation

### 2.1 Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Log in to your GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com) with username `Drakeyvespropulsion`
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner of the page and select "New repository"
3. Configure the repository:
   - **Repository name**: `video-training-funnel` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: "A professional React/Node.js web application with video training funnel and email capture"
   - **Visibility**: Public (or Private if preferred)
   - **Initialize this repository with**: Do NOT check any options since you have existing files
4. Click "Create repository"

After creation, GitHub will display a page with instructions for pushing an existing repository. We'll use these instructions in the next steps.

### 2.2 Note Your Repository URL

Your repository URL will be `https://github.com/Drakeyvespropulsion/video-training-funnel` (assuming you used the suggested repository name).

## 3. Local Git Setup

Follow the instructions in `GIT-SETUP.md` to:

1. Create a `.gitignore` file with the provided content
2. Initialize Git in your local repository
3. Connect your local repository to GitHub
4. Make your first commit

## 4. Repository Structure Verification

After pushing your code, verify that:

1. All documentation files (README.md, *.md) appear correctly on GitHub
2. The file structure matches your local project
3. Node modules and other files listed in `.gitignore` are not included

## 5. Branch Strategy Implementation

As specified in your README.md, your project uses the following branch strategy:

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch
- `feature/feature-name` - For new features
- `bugfix/bug-name` - For bug fixes

After your initial commit to the main branch, create a develop branch:

```bash
git checkout -b develop
git push -u origin develop
```

## 6. Repository Settings

Configure these recommended repository settings on GitHub:

1. **Default Branch**: Set `develop` as the default branch for development work
   - Go to Settings > Branches > Default branch > Switch to `develop`

2. **Branch Protection Rules** (optional but recommended):
   - Go to Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules > Add rule
   - Apply to: `main` and `develop`
   - Require pull request reviews before merging

3. **GitHub Pages** (if you want to showcase your frontend):
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main` (or create a dedicated `gh-pages` branch)
   - Folder: `/frontend/build` (after building your frontend)

## 7. Next Steps After Repository Setup

After setting up your repository, these are the recommended next steps:

1. Create a project board to track progress on GitHub (optional)
2. Setup GitHub Actions for CI/CD (optional)
3. Continue with your development roadmap:
   - Install required dependencies
   - Configure development environment
   - Begin Phase 2: Frontend Core

## 8. Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### 8.1 "Permission denied" errors
Solution: Ensure you're using the correct GitHub credentials or configure SSH keys

### 8.2 "Failed to push some refs" errors
Solution: Pull the latest changes before pushing (`git pull --rebase origin main`)

### 8.3 Large files failing to push
Solution: Add them to `.gitignore` or use Git LFS for large files

## 9. Useful Git Commands Reference

```bash
# Check repository status
git status

# Create and switch to a new branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Stage specific files
git add frontend/src/components/new-component.jsx

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add new component for video player"

# Push changes to GitHub
git push origin feature/new-feature

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin develop
```

## Conclusion

Following this plan will establish a solid foundation for your project on GitHub. The repository will be structured according to best practices and ready for collaborative development according to the workflow guidelines specified in your README.md.
