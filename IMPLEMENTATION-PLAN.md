## LLM Query Guidelines

When using AI tools like this one for ongoing development support, follow these guidelines from [RESPONSIVE-DESIGN-PLAN.md](./RESPONSIVE-DESIGN-PLAN.md):

### Query Construction
- Include project context
- Specify the current phase and component
- Reference specific technical requirements

### Examples of Effective Queries

```
"For the Video Training Funnel project, help implement the exit intent detection 
logic as specified in Phase 5 of IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md, ensuring it works 
correctly on both desktop and mobile platforms."
```

```
"I'm implementing the video player component for the Training Videos Page. Based 
on the specifications in IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md and RESPONSIVE-DESIGN-PLAN.md, 
how should I adapt the controls for touch interfaces while maintaining the same 
visual design?"
```

```
"According to our implementation plan, I need to connect the Email Capture Form 
to the backend API. Can you help me implement the form submission logic that 
aligns with the API endpoints defined in Phase 6 of IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md?"
```

### Maintaining Context
- Reference previous implementation decisions
- Link to relevant documentation files
- Specify the current implementation phase
- Include any constraints or requirements
