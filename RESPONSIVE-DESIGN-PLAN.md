## Design Principles

### Desktop-First with Mobile Adaptation
- Begin with desktop designs as the primary experience
- Adapt layouts to mobile while maintaining functionality and impact
- Ensure content hierarchy remains consistent across devices

### Pixel-Perfect Implementation
- Maintain precise spacing, sizing, and alignment as defined in designs
- Use relative units (rem, em, %, vh/vw) to ensure scalability
- Implement consistent component sizing ratios across breakpoints

### Feature Parity
- Ensure 100% functional parity between desktop and mobile
- Adapt interaction patterns to suit touch interfaces on mobile
- Optimize performance for lower-powered devices

### Progressive Enhancement
- Core functionality must work on all supported devices
- Add enhanced features for devices with greater capabilities
- Gracefully degrade experiences when necessary

## Breakpoint Strategy

We will implement a responsive design using the following breakpoints:

```css
/* Mobile (Portrait): 320px - 479px */
@media screen and (max-width: 479px) { ... }

/* Mobile (Landscape): 480px - 767px */
@media screen and (min-width: 480px) and (max-width: 767px) { ... }

/* Tablet: 768px - 1023px */
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px) { ... }

/* Desktop: 1024px - 1439px */
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) and (max-width: 1439px) { ... }

/* Large Desktop: 1440px+ */
@media screen and (min-width: 1440px) { ... }
```

### Mobile-Specific Considerations
- Touch targets minimum size of 44px × 44px
- Simplified navigation (hamburger menu)
- Stacked content blocks instead of side-by-side layouts
- Reduced padding and margins
- Font size adjustments for readability

## Component-Level Responsiveness

### Layout Components
1. **Header Component**
   - Desktop: Full navigation with all links visible
   - Mobile: Collapsed hamburger menu with animated dropdown
   
2. **Footer Component**
   - Desktop: Multi-column layout
   - Mobile: Single-column stacked layout

### Video Components
1. **Video Player**
   - Desktop: Large format with adjacent controls
   - Mobile: Full-width with overlay controls to maximize screen usage
   - Maintain 16:9 aspect ratio across all devices

2. **Video Progress**
   - Desktop: Expanded timeline with preview thumbnails
   - Mobile: Simplified timeline without previews

### Form Components
1. **Email Capture Form**
   - Desktop: Inline layout with side-by-side fields
   - Mobile: Stacked form fields with full-width inputs
   - Touch-optimized input fields with increased height

2. **Exit Intent Popup**
   - Desktop: Modal dialog positioned center-screen
   - Mobile: Full-screen overlay with optimized controls

### UI Components
1. **CTA Buttons**
   - Desktop: Standard sizing with hover effects
   - Mobile: Larger touch targets with active states instead of hover

2. **Testimonial Slider**
   - Desktop: Multiple items visible simultaneously
   - Mobile: Single item view with swipe navigation

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Set up CSS architecture (variables, mixins, utility classes)
- [ ] Create responsive grid system
- [ ] Implement base typography that scales across devices
- [ ] Build responsive container components

### Phase 2: Core Components (Week 2)
- [ ] Implement responsive header and navigation
- [ ] Build responsive footer
- [ ] Create base responsive layouts for all pages

### Phase 3: Video Components (Week 3)
- [ ] Develop responsive video player component
- [ ] Implement video progress and controls
- [ ] Create video navigation system

### Phase 4: Interactive Elements (Week 4)
- [ ] Build responsive form components
- [ ] Implement exit intent functionality
- [ ] Create CTA buttons and interactive elements

### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization (Week 5)
- [ ] Performance optimization for mobile devices
- [ ] Animation refinement for both platforms
- [ ] Final responsive adjustments
- [ ] Cross-browser testing

## Testing Strategy

### Device Testing Matrix
- **Desktop Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- **iOS Devices**: iPhone SE, iPhone 12/13/14, iPad, iPad Pro
- **Android Devices**: Samsung Galaxy S21/S22, Google Pixel 6/7, Samsung Tab

### Testing Methodology
1. **Component Testing**
   - Test each component independently at all breakpoints
   - Verify layout, functionality, and behavior
   - Document any discrepancies

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test components working together in page contexts
   - Verify interactions between components
   - Check layout flow and content hierarchy

3. **User Flow Testing**
   - Complete end-to-end user journeys on each device
   - Verify all functionality works as expected
   - Measure performance metrics

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Page load times (target: < 2s on 4G connections)
   - Time to interactive (target: < 3s)
   - Smooth scrolling and animations (target: 60fps)

## Maintenance Guidelines

### CSS Organization
- Follow BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology
- Keep style blocks under 50 lines where possible
- Comment on complex selectors and media queries
- Group related media queries with their base styles

### Component Documentation
- Document responsive behavior for each component
- Include visual examples of each breakpoint
- Note any platform-specific behaviors or limitations

### Update Process
1. Document changes in the change log
2. Update designs in both desktop and mobile views
3. Implement changes with responsive principles in mind
4. Test across the device matrix
5. Document any new responsive patterns

## LLM Query Guidelines

When using LLM tools to maintain development context throughout the implementation process, follow these guidelines:

### Effective Query Patterns

1. **Context Preservation**
   - Begin queries with project context: "For the Video Training Funnel project with responsive design requirements..."
   - Reference specific documentation: "According to RESPONSIVE-DESIGN-PLAN.md, section on Video Components..."
   - Mention current implementation phase: "Currently in Phase 2 (Core Components) of the responsive implementation..."

2. **Specificity**
   - Include device context: "For mobile viewport (320-479px)..."
   - Reference specific components: "For the email-capture-form.jsx component..."
   - Include technical constraints: "Using CSS Grid while maintaining IE11 support..."

3. **Continuity**
   - Reference previous queries: "Following our previous discussion about responsive navigation..."
   - Link to implementation goals: "To achieve the pixel-perfect implementation required in our design principles..."
   - Connect to testing outcomes: "Based on testing findings from Samsung devices..."

### Query Examples

✅ Good: "For the Video Training Funnel project, help implement the responsive hamburger menu for mobile viewports as specified in RESPONSIVE-DESIGN-PLAN.md, using CSS transitions for smooth animation."

❌ Poor: "How do I make a hamburger menu?"

✅ Good: "Following our implementation of the responsive video player component, help adapt the video-controls.jsx for touch interfaces on mobile devices while maintaining the same functionality described in the Component-Level Responsiveness section."

❌ Poor: "How do I make video controls work on mobile?"

### Documentation Updates
Remember to document any significant insights or approaches gained from LLM interactions in the appropriate documentation files, maintaining the modular file structure and 500-line limit.
